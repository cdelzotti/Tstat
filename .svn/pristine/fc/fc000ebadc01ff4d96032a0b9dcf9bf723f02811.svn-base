In order to compile the DNSCache static library
the follow steps must be followed:

g++ -g -c DNSCache.cpp -o DNSCache.o
g++ -g -c DNSEntry.cpp -o DNSEntry.o
ar rcs libdnscache.a DNSCache.o DNSEntry.o

To be used by tstat the modified version of 
Makefile must be used. It contains particularly
all the code, but at the end everything is linked
(final target 'tstat') using g++ instead of gcc.
