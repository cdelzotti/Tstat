Log_DNS and LDNS

The parsing of the DNS information in TSTAT to generate the log_dns is based on the
usage of the LDNS library (https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/about/)

Since it is not a standard library in many Linux distributions, the log_dns features 
are not included by default in Tstat, but must be enabled at compilation time, using
the 'configure' --enable_dns command line option.

'ldns' and 'ldns-devel' distribution packages are available for the most popular Linux
distributions, otherwise the library can be installed from the source code.
If the library and the includes are in the default system locations, the command

./configure --enable_dns

should succeed, reporting, for example

 $ ./configure --enable-ldns
 [ ... verbose configure information ... ]
 -------------------------------------------------
   tstat Version 3.2.0
   -lpcap -lpthread -lm  -lrrd -lldns

   Prefix: '/usr/local'

   Package features:
    - pcap      yes
    - zlib      no
    - rrd       yes
    - ldns      yes
    - libtstat  no
    - rrdthread no
 --------------------------------------------------
 $

If there is any issue or the files are not in the default locations, the 'configure' 
command will fail.

As a reference for a non standard installation, when Tstat is compiled on MacOS, 
the ldns package is not normally not available.
It can be installed, for example, using MacPort ('port install ldns') but the libraries 
will be in a non-standard location, so information must be provided to 'configure' to find
them

 $ CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib/" \
   CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/" ./configure --enable-ldns

Other system might require different options to let 'configure' fully locate all the
LDNS dependencies.

Using the '-v' Tstat command line option it is possible to know if LDNS has been included in
the current runtime or not.

 $ tstat -v
